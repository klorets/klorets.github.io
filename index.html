<p>Talents: Single Target</p>
<p>All Notes:</p>
<p>Move into <a href="http://wowhead.com/?spell=244761">Annihilation</a> (green circles on the ground), damage is split between everyone in each circle.</p>
<p>Move away if you get targeted by Decimation. Stay out of giant green circles.</p>
<p>Run out of green lines on the floor during Apocalypse Drive. After a weapon is killed, run far away from the boss.</p>
<p>Damage Notes:</p>

<p>When a weapon platform is destroyed after Apocalypse Drive, Searing Barrage hits random players.</p>

<p>Taunt swap on Fel Bombardment, and the tank with it run away from the boss and players. Movespeed increases help.</p>
<p>When a weapon is killed after Apocalypse Drive, one tank with a big cooldown should stand close to the boss.</p>
