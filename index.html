All Notes:
Move into <a href="http://wowhead.com/?spell=244761">Annihilation</a> (green circles on the ground), damage is split between everyone in each circle.
Move away if you get targeted by Decimation. Stay out of giant green circles.
Run out of green lines on the floor during Apocalypse Drive. After a weapon is killed, run far away from the boss.
Damage Notes:
Attack a weapon when Apocalypse Drive starts - kill the Annihilator first. (Normal) This happens at 60% and 20%. (Heroic) This happens at 65% and 35% health.
Healer Notes:
When a weapon platform is destroyed after Apocalypse Drive, Searing Barrage hits random players.

Taunt swap on Fel Bombardment, and the tank with it run away from the boss and players. Movespeed increases help.
When a weapon is killed after Apocalypse Drive, one tank with a big cooldown should stand close to the boss.
